Cuttlebelle's watch tries hard to only render what you changed. But that can sometimes fail and it does less work than required. If you ever change something
and it doesnâ€™t appear in your browser, chances are Cuttlebelle was a bit over-eager to save time. For those cases you have the double-save.
If you save your document or your layout twice in a row, just like a double click, Cuttlebelle will render all pages for you again.

![A screenshot of the watch showing that at first generating all pages took 10s but subsequent saves took only 0.009s](/assets/img/watch.png)

Note from the screenshot above the time it took to generate all pages (~ 10s) vs the time it took to save only one (~ 0.009s).

This can be really handy when adding content and developing layouts while keeping the default render time as low as possible.
